# requirements.txt (generated)
# Core dependency declared in pyproject.toml
crewai[tools]>=0.148.0,<1.0.0

# Additional packages used directly in code (not guaranteed bundled by crewai extras):
pydantic>=1.10.0
openai>=0.27.0

# Notes / assumptions:
# - `crewai[tools]` is declared in pyproject.toml and should provide crewai and tools like crewai_tools/SerperDevTool.
# - `openai` is included because RAGStorage embedder config references an "openai" provider.
# - `pydantic` is included explicitly since the code uses Pydantic models.
# - Local module `src/stock_picker/tools/push_tool.py` provides PushNotificationTool and does not need to be installed.
# If you want stricter pinning, run `pip-compile` or provide exact versions.
